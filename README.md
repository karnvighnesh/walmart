#  Project Overview

In this case study, I analyzed Walmartâ€™s Black Friday transactional data to understand customer spending behavior, focusing on differences across gender, marital status, and age groups. The aim was to uncover whether women spend more per transaction than men, and to provide actionable recommendations to help Walmart improve its marketing strategies and increase sales.

# Business Problem

Walmart's management wanted to determine if there are significant spending differences between male and female customers (assuming 50 million in each group) and explore patterns based on marital status and age. Understanding these differences would help Walmart design more targeted promotions and improve customer segmentation.

#  Approach & Analysis
Data Exploration & Cleaning:

Explored dataset structure, checked data types, handled null values, and detected outliers using boxplots and descriptive statistics.

Descriptive Analysis:

Calculated average spending per transaction for males and females.

Analyzed the spending distribution for married vs. unmarried and different age bins.

Statistical Analysis (Central Limit Theorem & Confidence Intervals):

Constructed 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for mean spending of male and female customers.

Checked for overlap in confidence intervals to assess statistical significance.

Repeated the same analysis for marital status and age categories.

Visual Analysis:

Boxplots to illustrate spending distribution across age groups.

Histograms, distplots, and countplots for categorical and continuous variables.

Heatmaps and pair plots for exploring feature correlations.

# Recommendations
Targeted Promotions for Women:

Offer personalized discounts or bundle deals to encourage higher per-transaction spending.

Category-Specific Strategies:

Promote electronics and high-ticket items more aggressively to men.

Focus fashion, home, and grocery discounts for women based on observed preferences.

Loyalty & Reward Programs:

Introduce rewards that incentivize larger baskets or higher transaction amounts, particularly for women.

Age-Based Personalization:

Maintain broad targeting since spending habits are consistent across age groups, but consider leveraging outlier behavior for premium product upsells.
